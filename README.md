************************************************
### **CUSTOM WAKEWORD ACTIVATION**  
************************************************
1. You can choose to either Enable or Disable the custom wakeword activation in the config.yaml file.  
2. In the config.yaml file, under Wakewords, change the **"Custom_Wakeword"** to 'Enabled' if you want to use the custom wakeword or set it to 'Disabled' if you dont want to use the custom wakeword option.  
3. For changes to take effect, you need to restart the assistant. Changing status while an instance of assistant is already running will not cause any change.  
4. Create your custom snowboy model [here](https://snowboy.kitt.ai). Add the models to **/GassistPi/src/resources**  directory.
5. Change the paths to the models in the config.yaml file.  
6. To disable the default **"Ok Google"** hotword, set the **Ok_Google option to "Disabled"**.  
7. Users using pushbutton.py or Pi Zero users have an option between using custom wakeword and GPIO trigerring. If custom wakeword is enabled, then GPIO trigger will not work. To enable GPIO triggering, set custom wakeword to 'Disabled'.    

************************************************
### **PLAYING SPOTIFY PLAYLIST**  
************************************************
**NOTE: Spotify API currently only supports playback in a web browser, but DRM content is being blocked in the Raspberry Pi. As a roundabout approach, I have programmed the assistant to get the playlist details using Spotipy API and then fetch those tracks from YouTube. This custom program has a better accuracy than spotify playlist playback using mpsyt.**   

1. Click [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and register for a spotify developer account, if you already don't have one.  
2. In the developer's dashboard, choose "**CREATE A CLIENT ID**". In the pop-up window provide the requested details.

*******************************************************************
### **PUSHBUTTON TO STOP MUSIC/RADIO PLAYBACK AND MUTE MICROPHONE**  
*******************************************************************
Connect a pushbutton between GPIO23 and Ground. Single press mutes microphone and double press stops music streaming.  


************************************************
### **VOICE CONTROL OF GPIOs, SERVO and Pi SHUTDOWN**
************************************************
The default GPIO and shutdown trigger word is **trigger**. It should be used for controlling the GPIOs, servo and for safe shutdown of Pi.

It has been intentionally included to prevent control actions due to false positive commands.  If you wish to change the trigger word, you can replace the '**trigger**'in the main.py code with your desired trigger word.

The default keyword for servo motor is **servo**. For example, the command **trigger servo 90** will rotate the servo by 90 degrees.   

If you wish to change the keyword, you can replace the 'servo' in the action.py script with your desired keyword for the motor.

For safe shutdown of the pi, command is: **trigger shutdown**  

You can define your own custom actions in the **actions.py** script.  
**THE ACTIONS SCRIPT OF THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM AIY KIT's SCRIPT, COPY PASTING THE COMMANDS FROM AIY's ACTION SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK HERE. FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACTIONS FILE, FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING YOUTUBE VIDEO.**

### **VOICE CONTROL OF NodeMCU**
************************************************
There are two ways to control NodeMCU:  
1. Control of NodeMCU running a webserver.  
2. Control of NodeMCU running Sonoff-Tasmota Firmware.  

### **Controlling NodeMCU running webserver**   
Download the Arduino IDE code for Nodemcu from here: https://github.com/shivasiddharth/iotwemos/blob/master/Google-Home-NodeMCU.ino  

Add the wifi credentials, make the desired changes and upload the Arduino code onto the NodeMCU and get the IP address from the serial monitor.  

Add the NodeMCU's IP address in the **config.yaml**.  

**Syntax: "Hey Google, Trigger Turn _Devicename_ On/Off"**    

**FOR GUIDELINES ON MODIFYING THE ARDUINO CODE AND ACTIONS.PY FILE, FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING YOUTUBE VIDEO.**    

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ae0iwJ62uaM
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ae0iwJ62uaM/0.jpg"
alt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

### **Controlling NodeMCU running Sonoff-Tasmota firmware**  
Download the Tasmota firmware from this [link](https://mega.nz/#!Dwx0lDYL!CK_QYoR9GvBhqdEmVs98ac45TjTjPIQyeaezYT4jfE0)

Follow the instructions in this video to upload the firmware properly.  

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MzcAS-K_TRU
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/MzcAS-K_TRU/0.jpg"
alt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>  

Pi3 and Pi Zero users, assign the device names and device ip addresses in the **config.yaml** in the marked locations.  

**Syntax: "Hey Google, Turn _Devicename_ On/Off"**

It is also possible to switch several devices at the same time.
**Syntax: "Hey Google, Turn _Devicename1_ _Devicename2_ _..._ On/Off"**

Advantage of using Sonoff-Tasmota over webserver is that, with Sonoff-Tasmota you can emulate a Wemo switch and control the NodeMCU using Amazon Alexa (Echo Devices) in addition to the GassistPi.    


************************************************
### **CASTING YouTube VIDEOS TO Chromecast**    
************************************************
Default command for casting YouTube videos is **Play *Desired Video* on Chromecast**, with **Chromecast** as the trigger word.
Example: **Hey Google, Play MasterChef Season 1 Episode 1 on Chromecast** casts the MasterChef YouTube Video.  

**Note: YouTube casting to Chromecast using third party scripts has been blocked, so I have taken a roundabout approach and as a result, you may not find the usual YouTube interface on Chromecast.**  

************************************************
### **CONTROLLING Chromecast BY VOICE**    
************************************************   
First, add the IP-Address of your Chromecast in the actions.py script, in the indicated location.  

Following are the default commands for controlling Chromecast with **Chromecast** as the trigger word.    
Pausing:  
Hey Google, Pause Chromecast  

Resuming:  
Hey Google, Resume Chromecast  

Stopping:
Hey Google, End Chromecast  

Change volume up/down:  
Hey Google, Chromecast Volume Up/Down  


************************************************
### **CCONTROLLING MEDIA BY VOICE**    
************************************************
You can change volume and pause or resume the Radio/YouTube/Google Music by voice.  
Pausing:  
Hey Google, Pause Music  (Entire phrase **Pause Music** is the trigger)

Resuming:  
Hey Google, Resume Music  (Entire phrase **Resume Music** is the trigger)

Volume Control (**Music Volume** is the trigger)

Increase/Decrease Volume:  
Hey Google, Increase/(Decrease or Reduce) Music Volume by ( a number between 0 and 100)   
If you do not specify a number, by default the volume will be increased or decreased by 10 units.  

Set Volume:  
Hey Google, Set/change Music Volume to ( a number between 0 and 100)   

Set volume to Maximum/Minimum:  
Hey Google, Set/change Music Volume to maximum/minimum

Change Tracks:  
Play Previous Track:  
Hey google, play previous  
Hey google, play previous song  
Hey google, play previous track  

Play Next Track:    
Hey google, play next   
Hey google, play next song   
Hey google, play next track   


************************************************

**Due to the Pi Zero's limitations, users are advised to not use the Music streaming feature. Music streaming will send the CPU usage of Pi Zero into the orbit.**  

************************************************
### **MUSIC STREAMING FROM Google Music**  
************************************************
The music streaming from Google Music uses [Gmusicapi](https://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Run the Google Music Authenticator once using:    
```
/home/${USER}/env/bin/python -u /home/${USER}/GassistPi/Extras/gmusicauth.py
```

### What you can do:
Play all your songs in loop using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play all the songs from Google Music"**

Play songs added to the user created playlist (does not include: most played playlist, thumsup playlist, etc) using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs from the first playlist from Google Music"**
Playlists are sorted by date created, if you have multiple playlists, use a similar syntax replacing first with second, third etc. Also you need to make suitable changes in the main.py (It has been commented in the script to help)

Play songs by a particular artist using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs by artist YOUR_ARTIST_NAME from Google Music"**

Play songs from particular album using the syntax: **"Hey Google, Play songs from album YOUR_ALBUM_NAME from Google Music"**

### What you cannot do at the moment: (some features may be added later):
Change tracks
Shuffle tracks
Repeat tracks

**Due to the Pi Zero's limitations, and computationally intensive nature of the Google Music streaming feature, this action has not been enabled for Pi Zero.**  


************************************************
### **RADIO STREAMING**  
************************************************
Default keyword for streaming radio is **radio**. For example, **play Radio 2** or **play Radio One** command will open the corresponding radio stream listed in the actions.py file.    

Radio streaming has been enabled for both OK-Google and Custom hotwords/wakewords.

Useful links for obtaining radio streaming links:   
http://www.radiosure.com/stations/  

http://www.live-radio.net/worldwide.shtml  

http://worldradiomap.com/map/  

**Due to the Pi Zero's limitations, users are advised to not use the Radio streaming feature. Radio streaming will send the CPU usage of Pi Zero into next galaxy.**  

***********************************************  
### **PARCEL TRACKING**  
***********************************************  
The default keyword for tracking parcel is **parcel**. For example, you can say **where is my parcel** or **track my parcel**.  

Regsiter for a free account with Aftership at https://www.aftership.com gnereate an API number and add parcels to the tracking list.
The generated API number should be added to the **actions.py** at the indicated location. For a better understanding follow the attached youtube video.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=WOyYL46s-q0
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/WOyYL46s-q0/0.jpg"
alt="Detailed Youtube Video" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

************************************************  
### **RSS FEEDS STREAMING**  
************************************************  
Default keywords for playing RSS feeds is **feed** or **news** or **quote**. Example usage, **top tech news** will play the top technology news, **top world news** will play top news related to different countires, **top sports news** will play the top sports related news and **quote of the day** will give some quotes.

Do not mix the commands with **Play** as that has been associated with music streaming from YouTube.  

**numfeeds** variable within the feed function in actions.py file is the feed limit. Certain RSS feeds can have upto 60 items and **numfeeds** variable limits the number of items to stream. The default value has been set to 10, which if you want can change.  


************************************************  
### **KODI INTEGRATION**  
************************************************  
### Enabling Kodi control    
In the config.yaml, under kodi, change control option from **'Disabled'** to **'Enabled'**.
